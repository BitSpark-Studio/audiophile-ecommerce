Its a chore to install TailwindCSS to use with CRA as PostCSS v8 is not support yet. This repo is just barebone CRA with tailwind, craco and their default configs.

Just do ``yarn install`` to install Tailwind and its dependencies.

To remove the current remote repository, run
``git remote rm origin``
and then add your desired remote with
``git remote add origin <your-repo-url>``
